# Assessing the lateral refraction of lower mantle heterogeneities from six-component single-station measurement

This repository contains six-component (6C) seismic recordings for deep seismology. The ring laser gyroscopes (G-ring) and the collocated seismometers at the Wettzell geodetic observatory, Germany, provide a fascinating opportunity to record broadband 6C ground motions with unprecedented accuracy for teleseismic events. We measure the arrival angle anomalies of core-diffracted shear waves (S<sub>dif</sub> waves) using the 6C point measurement.
